# Active Directory Homelab

Overview

This repository documents an Active Directory homelab used to learn core directory concepts, account lifecycle behavior, and safe PowerShell-based enumeration techniques. The lab prioritizes understanding how AD behaves before introducing automation, with a focus on read-only analysis and risk-aware operations.

The goal is to build practical intuition around identity hygiene, stale account detection, and operational safety rather than bulk automation.
