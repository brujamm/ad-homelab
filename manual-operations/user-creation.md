# User Creation
## 1/16/25

Set up Domain Controller using Windows Server 2022. Set up various OUs to simulate an office environment, modeled after different departments. Added users to corresponding OUs manually. Creating accounts manually reinforced the distinction between enabled accounts, disabled accounts, and service accounts, and highlighted the importance of proper OU placement. Will work on automating this process later.
